1. Check if ElasticSearch is Running
Open a browser or use curl to visit:
https://localhost:9200
You should see a JSON response with ElasticSearch version info, or a security/auth prompt.
Or, in PowerShell:
curl -k https://localhost:9200
The -k flag allows self-signed certificates.

Additional Features to Leverage ElasticSearch for Better User Experience
Full-Text Search:

Allow users to search within comments, diff text, or any text field using ElasticSearch’s full-text search (match, match_phrase, etc.).
Example: Search for a keyword in maker/checker comments or diff details.
Advanced Filtering:

Add multi-select filters (e.g., select multiple projects or actions).
Support range filters for timestamps (e.g., logs between two dates/times).
Aggregations & Analytics:

Show summary statistics (e.g., number of approvals/rejections per project, activity over time).
Use ElasticSearch aggregations to power dashboards or charts.
Export/Download Search Results:

Allow users to export filtered results directly from ElasticSearch (e.g., to Excel/CSV/JSON).
Highlighting Search Terms:

Highlight matching terms in the UI using ElasticSearch’s highlighting feature.
Performance with Large Data:

ElasticSearch can handle millions of logs—ensure UI supports deep pagination or infinite scroll for very large datasets.
Role-Based Access/Query Security:

Use ElasticSearch’s security features to restrict access to logs based on user roles (if needed).
